                                    These types of ads display across the top of the home page.  These are designed to catch the attention of the user towards your event.  They show up randomly with each new page and can be browsed through by clicking the arrow in the Featured Events box. They also show up in the reminder and "in the loop" emails.  They cost $2.00 per day.   You can find the option to make an event featured in the quick access box on the event itself or in your account info page under the Events Tab.

                                    Also known as cost per thousand.These ads you pay for a certain number of impressions.  How this work is:
                                    for every 1000 impressions you would pay $ .50 to $3.00 depending on the size of the ad
                                    So if you chose to spend $1000.00 your advertisement would be displayed 500,000 times across the screens of the viewers. (based on .50 add)

                                    Rather than paying for impressions, you are paying for every time someone clicks your ad and goes to your website or event page.  These type of advertisements typically cost more considering there is an action associated to the advertisement.
                                    You create your budget you are willing to spend on each advertisement
                                    Your ad will display until your budget is depleted
